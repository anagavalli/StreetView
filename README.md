# StreetView
WebGL based clone of Google Street View, with limited functionality. Images are of the Cornell University campus.

Run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" from the home directory then navigate to localhost:[portnum] to view the app.

Currently only supports viewing a single default scene.

Incoming features:
- Navigate to additional scenes
- Resize the viewport

Note that adding user provided scenes is NOT a planned feature.
